I always have trouble answering this question, I always reason it with "Why not?". I tend to make decisons very quickly and once I have a decison made up, that's it. 

I have always found an interest for coding, but never believed I would be capable enough. I attended a liberal arts college in the middle of Ohio and pursued the classic all incompensing, but doesn't really mean anything, B.A. in psychology. Unsure of what I would do with that degree after graduation, I moved home and found a job at a small nonprofit in my hometown. 

Jump to 2 years later, still at the same job, however I have found a new love of tech. Being the youngest, and by default the most tech savy in the office, I soon became the glorified IT person. This included working on issues that arose within the companies Salesforce system. The longer I worked with it, the more I grew to love that feeling of "Wow, I fixed/ made that!". After gaining a Salesforce Administrator Certification I longed to know more and to do more. I wanted to be able to actually understand how the system works instead of just knowing how to manipulate it properly. 

*For anyone who doesn't know Salesforce- here's a brief summary. The niche of Salesforce is that it is meant to be completely customizable without using any code. Obviously this is only somewhat true, you still do need developers. However for novice coders like me, you are able to manipulate the system and create/ fix things usually with little to no coding. *

In an effort to learn more about how coding, I spoke with many developers and women within the tech industry. One of those women had attended the software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron and raved about it. 

So why wouldn't I?
